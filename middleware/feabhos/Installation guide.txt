FEABHOS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

FeabhOS is a Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) designed to give a common API for teaching core operating system, and real-time programming, concepts.  As such, FeabhOS is not designed to be an all-encompasing OSAL, but it does contain enough elements to be practical and useful in production code.


File Organisation
-----------------

FeabhOS is structured as follows:

feabhOS
-- C              These folders contain the C API
      -- inc      Header files

   -- <PLATFORM>  Platform-specific implementation (currently Win32 and FreeRTOS)
      -- inc	    OS-specific definitions
      -- src      OS-specific implementations

-- C++03		  These folders contain the C++ API
   -- inc         Header files (and template classes)
   -- src         Class implementations

-- C++14      These folders contain the Modern C++ (C++11 onwards) API
   -- inc         Header files (and template classes)
 
   

NOTES:  
    The C++ implementation is built on top of the C API; so 
    the C API must be included even in a pure C++ project.
    
    The C++ implementations are mutually exclusive.  You cannot
    have both the C++03 and C++14 implementations active at the
    same time.  You must exclude one of the folders from the
    project.


Installing FeabhOS
------------------

The following steps must be performed to use FeabhOS in your project

********************************************************************
NOTE:
    FEABHOS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING OPERATING
    SYSTEM.  YOU MUST HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OS INSTALLED
    IN YOUR PROJECT BEFORE ADDING FEABHOS.

*********************************************************************

1.  Set up additional include paths.
    For C projects:
        feabhos/C/common/inc
        feabhos/C/<PLATFORM>/inc
       
    For C++ projects you must also add:
        feabhos/C++<version>/inc

2.  Add the feabhOS source files to your project.
    For C projects:
        feabhos/C/<PLATFORM>/src/*.c           [REQUIRED]
        feabhos/C/inc/*.h                      [OPTIONAL]

    For C++03 projects ONLY:
        feabhos/C++03/src/*.cpp                [REQUIRED]


3.  Rebuild your system.


NOTES:
	For Linux (POSIX) platforms you must compile
	with the C standard set to c99 (that is: -std=c99)
	This is required for all the timing functions.

  The C++14 implementation is header-only.  You do
  not need to add a source folder.
